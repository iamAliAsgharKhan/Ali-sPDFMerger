# Ali-sPDFMerger
A PDF merger with GUI and with Windows Executable 

A small program I created to solve daily PDF merging problem. Online solutions are limiting and some are premium so I made one for myself and wanted to share it with others.


The source code (main.py) requires PyPDF2 only, the rest are built in functions in a typical python package. 
Download the Windows Executable here [Ali PDf Merger](https://github.com/iamAliAsgharKhan/Ali-sPDFMerger/blob/master/main.exe)
